# In order to fit the model with glmmTMB we must first specify a time variable as a factor. The factor levels correspond to unit spaced time points. It is a common mistake to forget some factor levels due to missing data or to order the levels incorrectly. We therefore recommend to construct factors with explicit levels, using the levels argument to the factor function

# Evaluate Random Effect Variance: Examine the estimated variances for AR1 random effects for time and depth. Large variances suggest these structures are capturing meaningful patterns, while near-zero variances suggest overfitting or unnecessary complexity.

#Consider whether the Gamma family with a log link is the most appropriate for your data. If your residual diagnostics continue to look poor:
# Check for overdispersion (e.g., dispersion parameter much larger than 1).
# Try alternative distributions (e.g., negative binomial for overdispersion or log-normal for skewed continuous data).

# if specified.depth is a factor, how does it know which depths are next to each other? and same with week?

# Notes:
# The + 0 ensures that no intercept is included in the AR1 term (this is required syntax for the AR1 structure in glmmTMB)
#  Specifying two independent AR1 correlation structures, one for week (temporal) and one for specified.depth (spatial)
# The AR1 correlation structure in glmmTMB requires a grouping variable to define independent clusters where autocorrelation is assumed
# 1 as the grouping variable specifies that AR1 correlations are applied globally (i.e., across the whole dataset)
# The ar1 function in glmmTMB uses the levels of the factor to determine the temporal order. This avoids errors from non-sequential or improperly sorted numeric values
# When using an AR1 term in a glmmTMB model, you are assuming that the underlying correlation structure is not of primary interest, but rather a nuisance factor that needs to be accounted for to accurately estimate the effects of your fixed variables.

# DHARMa generates simulated residuals under the assumption of independence. If the AR1 terms successfully capture the autocorrelation in your data, DHARMa might still flag residuals as problematic because its default diagnostics do not fully account for the modeled correlation structure.
