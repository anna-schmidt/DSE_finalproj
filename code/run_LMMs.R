# if specified.depth is a factor, how does it know which depths are next to each other? and same with week?

# Notes:
# The + 0 ensures that no intercept is included in the AR1 term (this is required syntax for the AR1 structure in glmmTMB)
#  Specifying two independent AR1 correlation structures, one for week (temporal) and one for specified.depth (spatial)
# The AR1 correlation structure in glmmTMB requires a grouping variable to define independent clusters where autocorrelation is assumed
# 1 as the grouping variable specifies that AR1 correlations are applied globally (i.e., across the whole dataset)
# The ar1 function in glmmTMB uses the levels of the factor to determine the temporal order. This avoids errors from non-sequential or improperly sorted numeric values
# When using an AR1 term in a glmmTMB model, you are assuming that the underlying correlation structure is not of primary interest, but rather a nuisance factor that needs to be accounted for to accurately estimate the effects of your fixed variables.

# DHARMa generates simulated residuals under the assumption of independence. If the AR1 terms successfully capture the autocorrelation in your data, DHARMa might still flag residuals as problematic because its default diagnostics do not fully account for the modeled correlation structure.

# Trying altenative 

time_variable <- as.numeric(as.character(data_final$day))

                            time = time_variable)

# Our conclusions from the DHARMa simulated residuals are as follows: The QQ plot shows a pretty linear trend of points that tend to fall close to the red diagonal line, though some points do deviate from the line near the middle. We detect some overall deviations from the expected distribution with the dispersion test, but the KS test and outlier test are not significant. The residuals plot shows that some of the residual vs. model predictions lines are curved (red), which refers to quantile deviations, and we can also see four red stars which represent simulation outliers (data points that are outside the range of simulated values), which should be carefully interpreted. So overall, we have some reason to be hesitant about our model because of the items mentioned above that are pointed out in red on the figure. However, residual patterns don't indicate that the model is necessarily unusable, as we discussed in class.
